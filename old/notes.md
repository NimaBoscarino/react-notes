Why client side frameworks?
  Back end frameworks: 
    Express
      - routes defined with app.ROUTE listeners

  jQuery:
    - somewhere in the middle
    - document.querySelector

  React:
    - leverage abstraction
    - take advantage of Object Oriented Programming

Challenges of SPAs

- shift in business logic
- Backend role is more of an API role
- security ****

What are components

  in comparison ejs partials

  <% include .... header %> - EJS WAS ON THE BACKEND
  <h1><%= name %></h1>

  <PARTIAL href="asdasd" style="asdasd" prop="asdasd" />
